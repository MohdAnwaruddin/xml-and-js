I have worked on the javascript. 
First i have connect to the ApI provided in the project and use the below link
https://api.fda.gov/drug/drugsfda.json?&limit=20
I have run the query it gave me the json code. 
In Java script i have connected to the API using fetch library and  stored the response and extrcated the data.
I have created a list and used the id as results and mapped the items and stored in list and i have appneded it later to the html.

In order to get the items i have used two varibales which are el, key in this el will extract the object name and the key will extract the value associated with the variable 
I have ran the for loop and if the key present then we need to extrcat the value otherwise will extract the element.
